To run the code, simply modify the json file location and run the script

Notes: 
The env needs pylucene, and pytorch, others need can use equivlent commend as follows:

pip install flask transformers scikit-learn wordcloud

or conda install flask transformers scikit-learn wordcloud.

In the run script, we just run the python3 app.py

the flask will hold the server with specific port.(Currently since we deploy on the UCR server, we set to 8888)
